# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
I would put someone in the category of a spender if their spending score is above 50. If it would be below 50 than they would be considered stingy.
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
They would be in the stingy category.
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
For people with a high income and low spending interest you can expose them discounts and sales to have those people think they are saving money. You can also show these people items that are considered long term investments but are expensive as of now but it will save them money in the future.
