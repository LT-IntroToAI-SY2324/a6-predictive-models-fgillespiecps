# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The r squared coeffiecient in my model is from 0 to 1. It means how close my model is to being a good representation of explaining the data.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
My model is depends on the value.
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
It predicts the 10 year old as 8,752.18 and the 20 year old car as 1,827.89.
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
This is happening because the values are outside of the range of data.
