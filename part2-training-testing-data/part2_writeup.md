# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
There are more data points than the last model which makes the model more accurate and detailed.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
It tells me that the data in the model is not strongly coorelated and it isn't as accurate as it could be.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
It is moderatly accurate. The r squared coeffiecient backs up that claim. The predicted values are around 15.
