## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
0.98. It says that they are strongly coorelated.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
137.46
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
Because of the coorelation, the model can be reliable in predicting blood pressure by age. The only condition is that it would have to be for the average healthy person.
